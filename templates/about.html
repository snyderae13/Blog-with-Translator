                <p class="card-text">This blog is dedicated to all things style and fashion related. With a high focus on smaller, heritage insipired brands we try to bring the best information and insights into the world of high-quality clothing. Here at Style Blog, we don't merely see this as some sort of hobby or passing trend that comes as quickly as it goes. What we are trying to do here is cultivate a clothing "worldview": things that we buy and consume should be of the highest quality possible in order to reduce and delegitmize the concept of "fast fashion" and the culture of "one-time use" that is currenly plaguing not only the developed but also the developing world. </p>
                <p class="card-text">In order to combat the world of fast fashion, we must place our focus on clothing that is artisan made. What does it mean to be 'artisan made'? Well to put it simply : it is clothing that is made with the intention of standing the test of time. In order for this to be possible the materials like thread, fabric, buttons, and zippers must be sourced from the best possible suppliers that the clothing maker can find. Along with sourcing, the clothing must be made by those who possess the skills and experience to make the correct choices in stiching and pattern making in order to not only create a sturdy piece of clothing, but a beautiful piece that embodies the meaning of craftsmanship.</p>
